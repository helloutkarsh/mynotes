Basic Logically Consideration taken into account during development
* -> Blank Notes cannot be added
* -> Enough word length to keep overall profile slim, productive and to the point
* -> Avoided true black (#000000) to prevent eye strain because of contrasting shades
* -> Simple one click delete button to get items of the list
* -> Dedicated Fast Search for filtering out important notes

# Expected Future Improvements 
* -> Adding a **star button** for marking important events
* -> Adding user **login** and **sign up ** functionality supporting Google OAuth 2.0
* -> Adding a **Remove All** ,**Remove Selected**, **Remove Completed** and **Undo** (upto last 5 operations)
* -> Adding  customizable **color themes** useful for the diverse pair of eyes
* -> Adding **Upcoming** and **Completed** sections to facilitate addition of future tasks and having a record of completed tasks

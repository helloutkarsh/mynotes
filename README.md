Basic Logically Consideration taken into account during development
*  Blank Notes cannot be added
*  Enough word length to keep overall profile slim, productive and to the point
*  Avoided true black (#000000) to prevent eye strain because of contrasting shades
*  Simple one click delete button to get items of the list
*  Dedicated Fast Search for filtering out important notes

# Expected Future Improvements 
*  Adding a **star button** for marking important events
*  Adding user **login** and **sign up ** functionality supporting Google OAuth 2.0
*  Adding a **Remove All** ,**Remove Selected**, **Remove Completed** and **Undo** (upto last 5 operations)
*  Adding  customizable **color themes** useful for the diverse pair of eyes
*  Adding **Upcoming** and **Completed** sections to facilitate addition of future tasks and having a record of completed tasks
*  Adding **Priorities** section for filtering out starred notes with a single click
